## mapmetadata 4.0.0 (2025-02-17)

Thanks to the brilliant reviewer comments via the rOpenSci software
review (<https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/674>), this
release makes some major improvements to the clarity and functionality
of the package.   See this issue for a summary of the changes:
<https://github.com/ropensci/mapmetadata/issues/184>

Many of these changes relate to making the package easier to use, as
there is a heavy dependence on user interaction, improving validation
and testing, and complying with R package best practices.

Thanks in part to helpful rOpenSci editor comments

makes some improvements to the package, making it more suitable for the
rOpenSci software review process, which will be based on this new
release going forward.
